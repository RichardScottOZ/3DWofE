This capsule contains the scripts required for three-dimensional mineral prospectivity modeling of concealed ore deposits using the weights of evidence method. The scripts required for creating posterior probability and studentized posterior probability models using the ordinary and fuzzy weights of evidence methods are available in this capsule.
